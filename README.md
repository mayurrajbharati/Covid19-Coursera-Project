# Covid19-Coursera-Project
This is the Covid-19 Data Science Project which I did for the 'COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python' Guided Project under Ahmad Varasteh of the University of Genoa.
I used the Covid19 dataset published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country.
Also, I used the dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe in the 'happiness.csv' file.

I wrangled the data, manipulated it according to my requirements and finally merged both the datasets to bring the correlation.

I used data visualization tools to bring out the relationship between the various variables and finally came to a conclusion that **"Developed Countries are more prone to COVID19 than Under-Developed or Developing Countries, but this can be confirmed by making an analysis of the number of deaths in each country against the number affected"**.
